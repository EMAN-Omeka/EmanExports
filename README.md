# EMAN Exports

By Vincent BUARD for ENS-ITEM

This is a modified version of the CSV Export module [CSV Export plugin](http://omeka.org/classic/plugins/CsvExport/).

It offers the same functionality but :

- the produced files include all the result pages (and not just the currently displayed one).
- it offers an XML-TEI export format.

This last format is currently being designed. As of now it is strictly equivalent to the omeka-xml format.
